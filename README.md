# Piebot
Discord bot for my Discord server 

The code isn't so nice, would like to clean it up at some point. Most of the cogs are reused from another bot I wrote for another server with even messier code. It's getting better with each iteration :))
 
 It does moderation, reaction roles, going-live announcments twitch and music sharing with spotify
